Predicting Customer Churn for Telco Systems

Hello!

My name is Neel Chudasama and this is my capstone project submission for the Brainstation Data Science course.

In this project, I use Machine learning techniques to analyse and predict when a customer will churn. I produce many data visualisations to convey findings and as evidence for the decisions I make.

The dataset can be found within the Raw_data folder. 

The notebooks in orders as follows:

1. Loading and Cleaning Data
2. EDA
3. Preprocessing
4. Modelling

The files in this folder are: 

1. Raw_data folder - This contains telco_customer_churn.csv - The original dataframe which I loaded in notebook 1.
2. Data folder - This folder contains the .pkl files which contain two files. One version is after loading and cleaning the dataframe. The other file is after final preprocessing steps have been conducted on the dataframe.
3. .ipynb files
4. capstone_utils.py - This is a utils library imported in all my notebooks containing all the functions I used to analyse, visualise and conduct machine learning techniques.
5. capstone.yml - The conda environment needed to run these notebooks.
